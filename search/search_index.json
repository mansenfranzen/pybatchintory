It reduces maintenance efforts, improves performance and enhances observability by enabling following features:</p> <ul> <li>Incremental processing: Process only new, unseen data assets without custom bookmarking logic.</li> <li>Backfilling: Reprocess historical data assets in a configurable and automated manner without manual intervention.</li> <li>Configurable workloads: Define the amount of data assets to be processed for best predictability and efficiency.</li> <li>Transparency: Enrich processed data assets with job details like timestamp, identifier and parametrization.</li> </ul> <p>In order to leverage the above features, batch processing applications delegate the responsibility of generating batches of data assets to <code>pybatchintory</code>.</p> <p>The primary use case are file-based batch processing pipelines. For example, Parquet files are stored in a cloud object store like Azure Blob and need to be processed via Apache Spark twice a day.</p> <p>However, <code>pybatchintory</code> is not limited on any specific type or format because it is data asset agnostic. It is possible to generate batches of work that represent partitioning keys in table formats or distributed databases. </p> <p>Conceptionally, <code>pybatchintory</code> provides an API to generate and interact with batches of data assets while maintaining state and hiding implementation details. Only metadata about data assets is consumed while the actual data is not read.</p>"},{"location":"developer/#rationale","title":"Rationale","text":"<p>The following section summarizes the contextual background from which <code>pybatchintory</code> originates with its purpose and added value.  </p>"},{"location":"developer/#incremental-processing","title":"Incremental processing","text":"<p>Incremental processing greatly improves data pipeline performance by only processing unseen data assets. This prevents costly reprocessing of entire datasets. </p> <p>While incremental processing is supported in stream processing frameworks by design (e.g. Storm or Flink), this functionality is rarely available in batch processing frameworks. Only very few off-the-shelf solutions provide easy-to-use abstractions to handle incremental batch semantics (e.g., AWS Glue Bookmarks). More often than not, custom solutions are used in production environments. Typically, these rely on timestamp comparisons or manually maintained offsets which closely resembles what stream processing frameworks offer out-of-the-box.</p> Why not use stream instead of batch processing? <p>For non-time-sensitive tasks, batch processing provides two significant advantages over stream processing:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Resource efficiency: Batch processing allows for aggregation of large amounts of data at once, utilizing compute and memory resources more effectively while being more cost-effective overall.</p> </li> <li> <p>Managing complexity: Batch processing is easer to reason about because data is bounded and finite. Moreover, implementing complex logic on unbounded streams of data is very challenging to develop and maintain.</p> </li> </ol> What are other solutions for incremental batch processing? <p>More solutions exist which offer incremental processing. However, they tend fall short in one regard or the other.</p> <ul> <li>Databrick's Autoloader enables incremental processing of files in cloud objects stores, too. However, it does not support batch processing but only integrates with Spark Streaming and its associated limitations.</li> <li>Likewise, Flink's unbounded file data source continously monitors for new files at a given location. However, downstream computations using this data source can only run in unbounded, streaming execution mode.</li> <li>Apache Hudi's DeltaStreamer provides incremental processing semantics, too. Data can be ingested from various sources into Hudi tables only. Moreover, transformers allow to implement custom wrangling logic. However, this solution is limited to Java and may not be suitable for pipelines with high complexity.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"developer/#backfilling","title":"Backfilling","text":"<p>Reprocessing of data is not an uncommon theme. Bugs need to be fixed in production pipelines not just for future but also for existing past data. Added features such as new KPIs need to be made available not just from now on but also for the data of recent years. Hence, historical data needs to be reprocessed. </p> <p>However, first class support for such scenarios is currently not available. Processing all historical data at once can eventually become very costly and error prone because the accumulated volume of data may exceed a threshold of feasibility. Hence, manual planning and execution is often required to create processable chunks of work.</p>"},{"location":"developer/#configurable-workloads","title":"Configurable Workloads","text":"<p>Data assets are not generated evenly over time. Rather, the data generation process often exhibits seasonality and spikes resulting in greatly differing volumes of data per time interval. If auto-scaling is not available, processing applications may drastically drop in performance (e.g., due to insufficient memory forcing disk spills) or may even fail completely (e.g., out of memory error). Even with auto-scaling being enabled, performance degradation is likely because perfect parallelization via horizontal scaling is almost never possible in distributed systems. </p> <p>A simple and effective solution is to limit the amount of data to be processed at once by a single batch job. However, batch processing frameworks don't provide native support this functionality, yet.</p>"},{"location":"developer/#observability","title":"Observability","text":"<p>Frequently, doubts arise regarding data integrity and reliability. Customers may question results shown in an end user dashboard.
